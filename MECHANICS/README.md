# papyFeeder feeder mechanics

OpenSCAD files 

*The big part of this project*.

The main file is **papyFeeder.scad**. This file use the libraries:

"gears" from JÃ¶rg Janssen and contibutors Keith Emery, Chris Spencer
@ https://github.com/chrisspen/gears

and

"shape25" from papyDoctor
@ https://github.com/monnoliv/opensca-shape25

All the pieces designed by this file were built whith a Prusa MK3S printer (with the Bontech/Mosquito extruder upgrade ;) but this is not necessary)

Material: PLA (Prusament, Addnorth), Infill 100%, layers: 0.2mm

The other file is **reelsSupport.scad** that design a support for the tape reels. Printing two pieces of this and add 2 x D10mm of copper tube leads to a good support system for the reels.
